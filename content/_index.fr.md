intro_text: "Day by day it becomes increasingly clear that COVID-19 will have wrought lasting changes in our common sense understandings of “how the world works” and “our place in it.” All attempts to project how society, politics, and economic life might evolve must begin with our efforts, as singularities, embedded in linguistic and social-political communities, to formulate in words our experiences – plural – of the pandemic, and of the hopes and fears those experiences have generated. The Buffett Institute, with the French Interdisciplinary Group, has inaugurated, in collaboration with Northwestern’s partner university, the École Normale Supérieure of Paris, France, a cross-border, cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural, and cross-generational exchange of experiences, of thoughts about those experiences, and of theoretical exploration of those thoughts, as expressed by present and past doctoral students and faculty of the two institutions."

More reflections and essays will be added in coming months. The exercise will – Corona Virus willing – culminate in a colloquium to be held at Northwestern, May 5-7, 2021. If you are interested in participating in this exercise, please provide your name and contact information [here](#) so we can share details as they are finalized.

#### About this collaboration

The Living with Plagues project is a student-faculty meditation on COVID-19, organized in partnership with [the École Normale Supérieure (Paris)](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en), co-sponsored by the [Northwestern Buffett Institute for Global Affairs](https://buffett.northwestern.edu/) and [Northwestern’s French Interdisciplinary Group](https://fig.northwestern.edu/), and published with support from [Northwestern University Libraries](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/).  

The following collection of essays have been crafted by Northwestern and École Normale Supérieure faculty and students in response to rising questions for the collective and each individual -  

> The pandemic has crippled our ability to imagine normal routines again, and even evokes potential new disruptions – viral, economic, social, political, and, perhaps, most dire of all, atmospheric. The dominant “grand narratives” – neoliberal prosperity, peace through international cooperation, mastery over nature through science and technology – have lost credibility. The focus of the project, however, is not on our present disarray, but on our responses to the pandemic’s disruptions and on how they may be giving rise to new narratives. Forms of action are emerging that may be pointing beyond our present “conceptual confinement” toward new worlds of possibility.

The collection of essays will serve as core statements for reflection, analysis, and response in the upcoming **Living with Plagues Colloquium** for faculty, students, and guests scheduled for May 2021. 

If you are interested in participating the Colloquium, please provide your name and contact information [here](#) so we can share out details as they are finalized.
