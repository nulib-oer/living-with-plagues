The Living with Plagues project is a student-faculty meditation on COVID-19, organized in partnership with the École Normale Supérieure (Paris), and co-sponsored by the Northwestern Buffett Institute for Global Affairs and Northwestern’s French Interdisciplinary Group. 

The following collection of essays have been crafted by Northwestern and École Normale Supérieure faculty and students in response to rising questions for the collective and each individual -  

**The pandemic has crippled our ability to imagine normal routines again, and even evokes potential new disruptions – viral, economic, social, political, and, perhaps, most dire of all, atmospheric. The dominant “grand narratives” – neoliberal prosperity, peace through international cooperation, mastery over nature through science and technology – have lost credibility. The focus of the project, however, is not on our present disarray, but on our responses to the pandemic’s disruptions and on how they may be giving rise to new narratives. Forms of action are emerging that may be pointing beyond our present “conceptual confinement” toward new worlds of possibility.**

The collection of essays will serve as core statements for reflection, analysis, and response in the upcoming **Living with Plagues Colloquium** for faculty, students, and guests scheduled for May 2021.
